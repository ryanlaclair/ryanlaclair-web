While in school at RIT, I worked on a variety of research projects for the DIRS lab.
The first was working as a research assistant for a graduate student, testing, verifying and improving an algorithm that performed feducial tracking on video of a vehicle.
The next, and most significant project involved developing an algorithm and software to perform temperature emissivity separation from infrared spectral radiance data.
This software included an easy to use GUI that allows imaging scientists to perform these calculations in a much more intuitive environment.
