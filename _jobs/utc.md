I started at UTC as a Software Engineer for the Imaging Science group.
While in this group, I spearheaded a reasearch and development project to design a plugin based image processing framework.
The framework allowed for algorithm reuse and runtime chain configuration for different imaging systems.
I am now part of a group that works on the real-time messaging and management platform that all pieces of our airborne and ground software use to communicate.
