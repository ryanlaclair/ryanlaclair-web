        I am a Software Developer born is western New York (Rochester to be exact) and now living north of Boston in
        Lowell, Massachusettes.
        I work at UTC Aerospace systems, writing software to support airborne and ground imaging systems.

        I love learning new things - whether that means experimenting with building software, reading about new
        technology, or taking a new class at BU.
        I also love food (before becoming a software developer I worked as a chef in Rochester), good beer, my wife
        Fiona and my dog Hura.

        This website highlights the core of my formal education and employment up to this point in my life.
        I hope to continue to update it as I am exposed to new things and achieve new milestones in my career.
