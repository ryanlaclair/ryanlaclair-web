Imaging Science is the multidisciplinary combination of optics, imaging system engineering, color science, and image processing.
During my time at RIT, I focused my studies on image processing, and took a variety of Computer Science classes to obtain a minor in CS.
I worked on campus as a teaching assistant for the freshman and sophomore Image Processing classes, and as a reasearch assistant for the DIRS lab.
I won the John Wiley Jones Student in Science awar in Spring 2015, and graduated Magna Cum Laude with a GPA of 3.70.
