My employment at UTC Aerospace as a Sotware Engineer developing image processing software and algorithms continued to get me further interested in software development.
That is why I decided it was time to return to school, and work on my M.S. in Software Development.
At BU, I am learning modern web application and mobile development technologies which I hope to be able to put to use at UTC.
