I completed many of my core requirements at MCC, including Math, Physics and English.
It was also at MCC that I was first introduced to computer programming, in a class called 'Programming for Engineers'.
Looking back, this was quite a rudimentary class, but it sparked an interest that continued to grow throughout the rest of my time in school.
I graduated with distinction, with a GPA of 3.87.
